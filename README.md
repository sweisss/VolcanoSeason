A pseudo-phone app including a list of forecast links and an equipment checklist. 

These are basic HTML documents intented to serve as a simple, no-frills way of quickly 
checking the forecast for various voclcanoes and organizing equipment for upcoming trips. 

They can be saved to a Google Drive and then a homescreen shortcut to the documents can be saved on a smartphone.
The document shortcuts can then be grouped together to create the pseudo-app.
